ok well you'll have to open this in a commandline (e.g. cmd.exe on windoze).

if you do not have enough brain cells to work out how to do that, then you do not have enough brain cells to have any clue whatsoever as to what the hell is going on in this game.
if you do not know how to do that, one would assume you would find out using something like duckduckgo.
opencmd.bat is provided to drop you in the right directory.

WASD = typical movement as expected.
mouse = look as expected.
space = jump.

rmb = swap Z/W axes.
scroll = rotate Z/W axes around.
QE = W strafe.
RF = Y strafe.

good luck, have fun, and experiment.

to build this you will need SDL and enet.

no sound, sorry :(

each client must have the same maps and the same versions of the maps,
and must be able to handle the same path separator.
THAT MEANS YOU *MUST* DO dat/shortcut.4lv OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO SUPPORT PLATFORMS THAT AREN'T WINDOZE
IF YOU DO dat\shortcut.4lv I WILL FUCKING MURDERISE YOU FROM LIMB TO LIMB
ALSO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE PATH CASING *EXACTLY* RIGHT

i know better ways to handle that but what do you expect from a network protocol hacked together in 2 hours

DO NOT PLAY THIS ON THE OPEN INTERNET. IT IS NOT OPTIMISED FOR BANDWIDTH.
plus if someone manages to hack your computer, your problem, not mine.
hell, there's even comments in the source explaining potential hacks.

other than that, have fun!
